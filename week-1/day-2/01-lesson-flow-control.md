<!-- # Flow control -->

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Use if-else statements to control the flow of execution in a program based on conditions.
- Use loops to repeat actions in a program.
- Combine if-else statements and loops to create more complex programs.
- Apply flow control statements to solve real-world programming problems.
