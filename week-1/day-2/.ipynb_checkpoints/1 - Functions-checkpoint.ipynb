    "Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. It is a declarative style of programming that focuses on expressing what should be done rather than how it should be done. In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, which means **they can be treated like any other data type, such as integers or strings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming emphasizes the use of pure functions, which are functions that have no side effects and always produce the same output for the same input. Pure functions are deterministic and rely only on their input parameters to calculate the result, making them predictable and easy to reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key concepts in functional programming include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immutable Data**: In functional programming, data is typically immutable, which means once it is created, it cannot be modified. Instead, new data is created by applying transformations to existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Higher-Order Functions**: Functional programming languages support higher-order functions, which are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. This allows for more abstract and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursion**: Recursion is often used in functional programming to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar sub-problems. Recursion replaces loops in imperative programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **First-Class Functions**: In functional programming languages, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Map, Filter, and Reduce**: Functional programming languages commonly use functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to process collections of data in a functional way. These functions abstract away the details of iteration and mutable state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming languages, such as Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang, are designed with functional principles in mind. However, many mainstream programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Ruby, also support functional programming to varying degrees. Developers can apply functional programming concepts and techniques in these languages to write more concise, predictable, and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore functional programming concepts and how they can be applied in practice using Python, a language that combines functional and imperative programming paradigms."

    "\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Functions encapsulate specific behavior or logic, making it easier to organize and maintain code. Modular code is more reusable and easier to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: Functions allow you to abstract away complex operations behind a simple interface. This abstraction simplifies code consumption and promotes a clear separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Well-designed functions can be reused across different parts of your codebase or even in different projects. This reuse reduces duplicated code and promotes consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing**: Functions make it easier to write unit tests. With pure functions, you can predict the output for a given input, simplifying the testing process.\n",

    "In the world of programming, a paradigm is a fundamental approach or style for structuring code and solving problems.

But what exactly does this mean?\n",

    "##Â USER - DEFINED FUNCTIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can create your own functions to encapsulate a specific set of instructions and reuse them throughout your code. These functions are called user-defined functions. Let's break down the key components of user-defined functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`def`**: The `def` keyword is used to define a new function. It is followed by the function's name, parentheses, and a colon. For example, `def my_function():` defines a function named `my_function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`name`**: The name of the function is chosen by the programmer and should be descriptive of the function's purpose. It follows the `def` keyword, and in the example above, the name is `my_function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`params`**: Inside the parentheses, you can specify parameters (also known as arguments) that the function will accept. Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values you pass into the function when you call it. For example, `def greet(name):` defines a function that accepts one parameter, `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`args`**: Arguments are the actual values that you provide when calling a function. For instance, when you call `greet(\"Alice\")`, `\"Alice\"` is the argument passed to the `name` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`return`**: The `return` statement is used to specify what the function should output or return. Functions can perform calculations or processes and then return a result. For example, `def add(x, y): return x + y` defines a function that adds two numbers and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`docstrings`**: Docstrings (documentation strings) are used to provide a description of what the function does. They are enclosed in triple quotes (either single or double) and are placed immediately after the function definition. Docstrings help other programmers (and yourself) understand the purpose and usage of the function. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Defining input and output type, is part of clean code standards (however, not many people use it)\n",
    "  def greet(name: str) -> str:\n",
    "      \"\"\"\n",
    "      This function greets the person passed in as a parameter.\n",
    "      \"\"\"\n",
    "      return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **`source code`**: The source code of the function contains the actual instructions that the function performs. It is indented below the function definition and is executed when the function is called."

    "## Business challenge: Yoga Class Management\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are developing a program to manage yoga classes and students. Create a Python program that handles the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Create Yoga Classes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Write a Python function called `create_yoga_class` that allows the user to create a new yoga class. The function should store information about the class, such as the class name, date, time, and maximum capacity. Use a dictionary to represent a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Register Students:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Implement a function called `register_student` that allows students to register for a specific yoga class. Ensure that the program checks if the class is full before allowing registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Display Class Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Write a function named `display_class_details` that takes a yoga class dictionary as input and displays all its details, including the class name, date, time, registered students, and available spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. List All Classes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Create a function called `list_all_classes` that displays a list of all available yoga classes with their names and the number of available spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Search for Classes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Implement a function called `search_classes` that allows the user to search for yoga classes by specifying criteria such as date, time, or class name. Display a list of matching classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Remove Students:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Write a function named `remove_student` that removes a student from a yoga class if they need to cancel their registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Generate Attendance Report:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Create a function called `generate_attendance_report` that generates an attendance report for a specific yoga class. The report should include the names of all registered students.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use appropriate data structures (lists, dictionaries) for storing yoga class information and managing student registrations.\n",
    "- Ensure that functions include proper docstrings, data type annotations, and clear variable naming.\n",
    "- Test your functions with sample data to verify their correctness.\n",
    "- Allow the program to handle multiple yoga classes simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus Challenge:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend the exercise by implementing user authentication to allow only authorized instructors to create and manage classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will help students practice creating and using functions to manage yoga classes and students effectively.\n"
